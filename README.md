# ReactMusicVideoWebsite




## Large scale project idea

The origional idea for this project was to create a website which could make playlists of music videos from youtube. There would be a feature that would allow users to add songs to playlists and convert their playlists from streaming platforms such as spotify into music video playlists. The program would also filter through the videos and only add real music videos. A demo of this feature is in my project here: (INSERT PROJECT). This is still a work in progress. It currently displays clickable thumbnails from a youtube playlist. Clicking on a thumbnail sends you to the video.



## How to run

Navigate to the ReactMusicVideoWebsite folder

in the terminal run: npm run dev

visit http://localhost:3000

If running correctly you should see a collection of music videos from Pitbull









This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
